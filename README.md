🤖 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Usage Notice AI assistance was specifically used to create the 3D torus background animations in the "About Me" section of this project.

•Learned Topic: With the help of AI, I learned how to create and integrate interactive 3D graphics into a web page using a library like Three.js.
